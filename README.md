**Minecraft Clone Voxel Engine written using C++23 and OpenGL**

### Why this project?
I chose to make a minecraft clone project because I wanted to learn more about computer graphics and engine level development. When I was a kid I always used to play minecraft it was my favorite game, the amount of Creativity and the Building was my favorite part. Thats how I came to the conclusion to make a mini minecraft clone since I saw a few Videos how other people recreated it I got onto vscode and started coding this minecraft clone.
